## 📡 Mission Profile

**Tasman Dynamics [TasDyn]** is an Arma 3 modification project focused on high-fidelity heavy-lift logistics, experimental VTOL airframes, and advanced multi-domain vehicle systems.

Departing from standard re-textures, TasDyn integrates custom flight dynamics and advanced PhysX configurations to simulate the weight, torque, and inertia required to operate heavy hardware in the Pacific Rim theater.
