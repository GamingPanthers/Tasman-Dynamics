## 📡 Mission Profile

**Tasman Dynamics [TasDyn]** is an Arma 3 modification project focused on high-fidelity heavy-lift logistics, experimental VTOL airframes, and advanced multi-domain vehicle systems.

Departing from standard re-textures, TasDyn integrates custom flight dynamics and advanced PhysX configurations to simulate the weight, torque, and inertia required to operate heavy hardware in the Pacific Rim theater.

## 🛠️ Active Project: "The Roc"

**The Roc** is the flagship airframe of the Tasman Dynamics Aerospace Division. It is a strategic heavy-lift VTOL designed to bridge the gap between the tactical V-44 Blackfish and the strategic C-17 Globemaster III.

### Technical Specifications
* **Role:** Strategic Heavy Lift / Airborne Deployment
* **Length:** 53 meters (Approx. C-17 Scale)
* **Mass:** ~128,000 kg (Projected)
* **Capacity:** Main Battle Tanks (MBT) or multiple APCs via *Vehicle-in-Vehicle* (ViV).

### Key Features (In Development)
* **Strategic Scale:** A fuselage capable of swallowing a Slammer MBT whole.
* **Walkable Interior:** Full "Roadway" LOD allowing crew to move freely in the cargo bay during flight.
* **Airborne Ops:** Specialized rear-ramp geometry designed for HAHO/HALO paratrooper operations.
* **Advanced Physics:** A flight model that respects inertia—this is not a humming bird; it requires pilot discipline.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
**Tasman Dynamics** is executing a phased development cycle for *The Roc*:

- [x] **Phase 1: Concept & Import** (Static Mesh Integration)
- [ ] **Phase 2: Physics & Scaling** (Geometry LODs, Mass configuration)
- [ ] **Phase 3: Logistics** (Roadway LODs, Vehicle-in-Vehicle paths)
- [ ] **Phase 4: Flight Dynamics** (Rotorlib, Ramp Animation, Landing Gear)
- [ ] **Phase 5: Polish** (Texturing, Sounds, Particle Effects)
